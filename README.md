 This study investigates surfactant transport on
 the surface of a small spherical gas bubble rising
 in a quiescent, isothermal Newtonian liquid. The
 objective is to determine the steady surface con
centration Γ(θ) of an insoluble surfactant (with
 Γ denoting its mean value) and to quantify how
 interfacial advection and surface diffusion set its
 distribution. Under creeping-flow and axisym
metric conditions, the interfacial balance reduces
 to the steady surface advection–diffusion equa
tion on the bubble surface. (Have included all the matlab files created to analyse the above project for reference.,
